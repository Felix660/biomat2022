This repository contains all the lectures and code related to the course.

### Lecture 1: Topological Data Analysis
This lecture is about a general exposition of Persistent Homology and some applications. The slides of the lecture can be found <a href="https://"> here </a>.
The demo of the software Ripser can be found at this link. The synthetic point clouds to test are available at the folder _data_: cicle, sphere and torus.

### Lecture 2: Hands on: computational topology in action
This lecture is a live-coding exposition of the use of the software Ripser to compute Persistent Homology, and some real applications with concrete data. The datasets are available at the folder _data_.
The notebooks with the code and descriptions of the applications can be found at the folder _tutorials_:
 - Intro_Persistent_Homology: Introductory tools related to the computation of persistent homology with the software Ripser. It also contains the first simulations to verify properties of persistent homology and to infer topological features from synthetic point clouds.

### Lecture 3: Applications in dynamics
This lecture is about some applications of Persistent Homology to study dynamical systems and analize time series. The slides of this lecture can be found <a href="https://"> here </a>.
Some of the applications are based on recent work of the author: 
- Birdsongs: 
- Epilepsy:
